	          <h4 onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('custompop','','images/ssbgoku.jpg',1)">Original: Super Saiyan Blue Goku</h4>
	          <p>A simple custom. I simply took the original pop and painted over the blue hair with a folkart metallic paint. The result was a shiny metal color that pops out.</p>
	          <h4 onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('custompop','','images/customrose.jpg',1)">Custom: Super Saiyan Rose</h4>
	          <h4 onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('custompop','','images/ssgoku.jpg',1)">Original: Super Saiyan Goku</h4>
	          <p>A little more challenging custom. The original’s body was completely repainted from orange and blue to a metallic black and gray. The hair was also completely repainted from yellow to a metallic rose color. Eyes also needed to be repainted.</p>
	          <h4 onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('custompop','','images/customvegeta.jpg',1)">Custom: Metallic Super Saiyan Vegeta</h4>
	          <h4 onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('custompop','','images/ssbvegeta.jpg',1)">Original: Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta</h4>
	          <p>Another simple custom. The hair and eyes were painted from blue to a metallic gold. (The eye color is the wrong color but was done on purpose because I liked it.)</p>
	          <h4 onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('custompop','','images/customblack.jpg',1)">Custom: Black</h4>
	          <h4 onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('custompop','','images/kidgoku.jpg',1)">Original's: Kid Goku, Super Saiyan Goku</h4>
	          <p>A more difficult custom. Like the Super Saiyan custom the entire body had to be repainted. This time the body was painted matte colors instead of metallic. The head had to be swapped with another pop which made this a bit more difficult.</p>

	      <h1>About My Customs</h1>
	      <p>Getting better with Practice</p>
	       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My customs are still in a beginner’s level. My current custom collection consists of only pops that I have repainted to add to the aesthetic of the collectible. My first custom was the Metallic Blue Goku (main character in Dragon Ball Z). This was a very simple custom that consisted of only painting over the blue hair with Folkart metallic blue paint. The change was easy but the metallic paint simply looks amazing compare to the matte blue of the original. The same thing was done to the Metallic Vegeta, although it was more difficult. The original has blue hair, painting over the blue with the Metallic Gold paint was not as easy as paint blue on blue. It took more layers but eventually I was able to cover all the blue in the hair. 
		   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently my favorite custom is the Metallic Rose Custom. Like the other painting was all I did, unlike the others the entire body had to be painted over. Using Metallic Folkart paint I painted the body black and gray. The belt he wears was painted with a metallic red, the process was difficult as everything I do is freehand and my hand is not all that steady. I paint over the gray and black many times before I got it. The hair in the original is yellow, but for this certain pop I was able to use acetone to remove the paint from the hair allowing me to paint it much easier with less layers. The eyes are painted with the same paint used on the shirt. This custom took me much longer than the previous two but the I was very pleased with the results.
		   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My latest custom is Black one of the new characters introduced in the show. Like the Metallic Rose Custom, the body was completely repainted. The largest difference between this one and the Metallic Rose one is I had to swap the head of another pop in order to recreate the character in pop form.
