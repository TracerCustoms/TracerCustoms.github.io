	          <h3>What are Funko Pops?</h3>
	          <p>Funko Pops are licensed collectible vinyl figures produced by the American company Funko. The company was founded in 1998 by Frank Malone. In 2005 it was sold and now Brian Mariotti is the president of the company who has help lead the company to what it is today. Funko has signed licensing deals with many companies such as Marvel, DC Comics, WWE, Lucasfilm, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, DreamWorks, Hasbro, CBS, Fox, Warner Bros, Disney, HBO, Peanuts, BBC, NFL, Ubisoft, NBCUniversal, Cartoon Network, 2K Games, Bethesda Games and many more. Though the company manufactures many products their pop vinyl figures are their most known product. The popularity of Funko Pops continues to increase as new pops are being made inspired by some of today’s most popular Tv shows, games, and movies.</p>

	      <h1>What Is TracerCustoms?</h1>
	      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put is simply TracerCustoms is a brand I created that specializes in creating customs pops. It was created simply for fun and a way to keep myself busy. Although Funko manufactures hundreds of different pops for many different lines it is impossible to manufacture a pop for every character. My name is Hector; I’ve been collecting Funko Pops for about two years now. I enjoy collecting pops from Funko’s Animation, Gaming, and Heroes lines. My collection is currently sitting at 78 pops and continues to grow as new pops are being design for new and existing lines..</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all started when one of my favorite lines to collect got some new additions. Dragon Ball Z is one of my favorite shows growing up and till this day it reminds me of the time me and my dad spent watching it. Because it holds a special part in my heart, Dragon Ball was the line I started my collection with. After the show had ended years ago a new series was created to continue the story. With the new series came new collectibles. After watching a few episodes, I found myself wanting pop versions of some of the new characters introduced. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem likely that Funko would create those characters as pop, so I created my own. I bought paint and some paint brushes and created my first custom pop. Although I’m not talented I enjoyed painting and creating a unique pop that not many can add to their collection. After a couple customs I thought It would be cool to create a brand around it, thus TracerCustoms was born. I created a logo and now a practice site, and though this was all created for fun I might enjoy trying to actually make it something that people can recognize.</p>
