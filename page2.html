              <h3>Customs To Make</h3>
	          <image><img src="images/overwatch-logo-isolation.png" alt="" width="350" height="205" class="overwatchlogo"/></image>
	          <p>Overwatch is currently my favorite line to collect. Overwatch is a team based game that I really enjoy playing. It’s fun but what I really like is the character design and the world Blizzard created for this game. With each character a skin variant was created. This variant is as simple as a different color clothing to a completely different look for the character. Although Funko has released variants for their pops I don’t see them creating every possible one from game. I plan to create one pop for each variant in the game.</p>
	          <image><img src="images/2000px-Fallout_logo.svg.png" alt="" width="350" height="137" class="falloutlogo"/></image>
	          <p>Fallout has been my favorite gaming series for a long time. I’ve wasted countless hours trying to 100% complete some of the installments in Fallout. Funko has done great in making pops for almost all the key characters in the series. For this line I plan to repaint the pops to give them a more realistic feel. This line consists of many robots or metallic armor that the paint used does not do justice. I want to repaint them with metallic paint and use different techniques to give them a feel like they’ve been in battle.</p>
	          <image><img src="images/Dragon_Ball_Z_Logo.png" width="350" height="107" alt="" class="dbzlogo"/></image>
	          <p>Although all my customs so far have been from this series I plan to continue it. There are still many characters that I want to display on my shelfs that Funko will most likely to create. These customs will continue to be simple and I will continue to improve by repainting these pops.</p>

	      <p>Jack Morrison</p>
	      <p><img src="images/Jack Morrison.png" alt="jack" width="200" height="227" class="jack"/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far all the customs that I have created are simple repaints and a head swap from one pop to the other. A custom that I am currently getting ready to tackle is one for the Overwatch character Jack Morrison. From my current favorite game Overwatch, Jack Morrison is a playable character that I would love to see in pop form. Jack Morrison is the skin or costume for the character Soldier 76. Funko has already created two versions of Soldier 76, the regular version and a gold variant. Though I currently own both what I really would like is to have the young before the war Soldier, Jack Morrison. This will be hard job to tackle as I will need to find a pop with a similar hair style as Morrison. After that comes finding a body that matches Morrison, it won’t be perfect so I will need to use clay to shape it closer to the real thing. I think this project will be a ton of work but the end result can be an amazing addition to my collection.</p>
	      <img src="images/zelda.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="143" class="zeldabanner"/> 
	      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funko does not own any rights to manufacture pops for any Nintendo character. Nintendo does not give rights to any company to use their characters. Because of this it is very unlikely that we will ever see a pop from some of my favorite games. I grew up playing The Legend of Zelda, and with the new installment of Breath of the Wild I would love to create a Link pop. This will be a tough process and a lot of clay will be used to create it.</p>
